# Relay Clips

**Empowering your mobile with the raw power of your Mac.**

Clips are a new generation of ultra-lightweight applications designed for the Relay platform. While modern "native" apps often bloat to 800MB+, a Relay Clip delivers the same core functionality in just **2MB**. 

By shifting heavy processing to your local machine via the Relay Helper, we enable desktop-class performance and AI-driven tasks on your phone, without the battery-draining weight of legacy mobile software.

- **Privacy First**: Your data stays on your hardware. No cloud middlemen.
- **Distributed Power**: Use your Mac or PC to handle the heavy lifting while you interact from anywhere.
- **Community Powered**: A growing ecosystem of tools designed to make mobile work actually work.
