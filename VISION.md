# The Relay Vision

Relay isn't just another mobile framework; it's a fundamental reimagining of how we use our devices. 

In the current era, mobile apps are bloated, battery-hungry, and sandbox-restricted. We believe your phone should be a thin, lightweight window into your most powerful machines—not a standalone silo.

## The Paradigm Shift: Clips vs. Legacy Mobile

Relay Clips are built around a simple truth: **Processing belongs on the Desktop, Interaction belongs on the Mobile.**

| Feature | Legacy Mobile (Expo/Native) | Relay Clips |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Download Size** | 50MB - 1GB+ (Bloated) | ~2MB (Surgical) |
| **Runtime Mode** | Always Local (Locked) | Offline-First + Remote-Power |
| **Battery Impact** | Heavy (Device Heat) | Minimal (Offloaded) |
| **Processing Power** | Limited Mobile ARM | Unlimited i9 / M3 / CUDA |
| **Development** | Complex / Slow Builds | Instant / SDK-First |
| **Data Privacy** | Cloud/SaaS Dependency | Local-Network / Private |
| **System Access** | Heavily Sandboxed | Full Host Access (via Helper) |

## Why "Weight" Matters

A typical modern app is 400x larger than a Relay Clip while providing similar functionality. This bloat isn't just disk space—it's memory usage, battery drain, and cognitive load for the developer. 

By offloading heavy logic to the **Relay Helper**, we enable:
- **AI at Scale**: Run local LLMs or Stable Diffusion on your Mac GPU, with the interface in your hand.
- **True File Management**: Manage your real file system, not a virtual cloud drive.
- **Developer Freedom**: Write code that reaches through the screen to your real machine.

## Empowerment through Distribution

Today, we have AI tools that can do almost anything, but they are often trapped behind cloud subscriptions or restricted by mobile hardware. Relay empowers you to take the full power of your workstation anywhere you go.

We are building for the future where your mobile device is a portal, and your home/office machine is the engine.
